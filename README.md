Hello! And welcome to Johnnys Shared (Via DropBox): dropbox_dev_vault
```
/Users/johnycsh/Dropbox/local_dev_vault
You can think of this somewhat similar to <DOCROOT> in Apache etc
```

Currently I have no images / files  ... Lets try adding one from my iPhone/iPad and see how that goes.

## poorly
That is how the dropbox experiment went. I don't seem to be able to 'open' a vault that is located in DropBox from the Obsidian app on either iPad or iOS. Thus concludes this very brief experiment. I suppose next I will go back to Obsidians proprietary  (though very polished)'sync' mechanism, and see how that goes. *sigh*
